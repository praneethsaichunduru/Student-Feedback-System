# Student-Feedback-System
A DBMS Project which helps students give feedback to their faculty.

Online student feedback system is the web based feedback collecting system from the students and provides the automatic generation of a 
feedback which is given by students. We have developed student feedback system to provide feedback in a quick and easy manner to the 
particular department. So we called it a student’s feedback system which delivers via the student staff interface as an online system which
acts as a service provider. By using this technology, we can give feedback in online system faster when compared to the existing paper 
feedback system. The existing system carries more time to do a piece of work. For this reason, the online system feedback is implemented. 
Students will fill online feedback using a standard form. In this project security is also maintained, that is the result of feedback is 
only visible to authentic user.

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
● The purpose of the project is to reduce the strenuous work of physically examining the feedback pages of each and every student. The 
system also reduces the burden of efforts and burden of keeping and maintaining the records on a manual base, it requires a lot of space 
and safety to keep up such records.
● This system also makes selection process more effective.
● Questionnaires are of primary importance in the dialogue with students, since they are the best tool we currently have for collecting 
objective, detailed and reasonably systematic information on a wide range of questions, which informs the teacher about student’s 
perceptions of the course's strengths and weaknesses.
